ICC T20 World Cup 2022 — Player Performance Insights Dashboard

A visually rich, interactive analytics experience designed to break down batting styles, player categories, strike-rate distribution, and performance consistency across tournament stages.

📝 2. Short Description / Purpose

This dashboard provides a high-impact analytical view of the key batting contributors during the ICC T20 World Cup 2022.

⭐ 5. Features / Highlights
✔ Business Problem

Cricket analysts, selectors, and performance teams struggle to access a single comprehensive view of player contributions across roles, match situations, and batting patterns. Raw scorecards don’t immediately reveal efficiency, pressure performance, or consistency trends.

Questions like:

Who are the top power hitters?

Which batters maintain strike rate under pressure?

Who contributes consistently across innings?

How do teams compare based on batting role strengths?
…are not easily answered without a centralized system.

✔ Goal of the Dashboard

To deliver a high-fidelity, interactive Power BI solution that:

Profiles every major batter in the tournament

Compares performance metrics side-by-side

Highlights key contributors by batting roles

Presents time-series performance for consistency analysis

Provides scouting, selection, and strategy-ready insights
