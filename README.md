## ⭐ 5. Features / Highlights

### ✔ **Business Problem**
Cricket analysts, selectors, and performance teams often struggle to get a **centralized, comparative view** of player performance across roles and match scenarios. Raw scorecards don’t clearly show:

The dashboard bridges this analytical gap.

- Profiles every key batter in the tournament
